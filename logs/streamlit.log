2025-08-05 09:47:33,526 - INFO - Assistant response: When there is an unsuccessful monthly payment plan (MPP) installment payment, the student will receive an email notice. If the balance remains at $0 or yields a refund after the unsuccessful payment, no billing notice will be sent. However, any missed payments beyond the first one will result in cancellation of the MPP. If a student has a Past Due Balance due to an unsuccessful installment, they may need to pay at the Cashier's Office for the payment to be made and the financial hold to be lifted, even though the balance on Flywire shows as $0.

2025-08-06 11:25:15,839 - INFO - Assistant response: If the proxy initiated an international wire transfer on July 30th and it's not being posted on the bill yet, it may be due to the funds taking longer than usual to process through CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce). The funds received by CIBC are delivered to UM within 2-3 business days after completion. However, if more than a week has passed and the funds have not been posted, it's recommended to contact the CC team for further assistance.

2025-08-07 11:24:41,718 - INFO - Assistant response: Yes, a Past Due hold will be placed on the student's account if charges are unpaid.

If a student has multiple issues, they should first speak with a CC Associate before being handshaked to Collections for assistance regarding collections cases. Additionally, if a refund check is sent to a closed bank account, the student is responsible for contacting their banking institution to obtain the funds.

2025-08-07 12:01:36,102 - INFO - User query submitted: Student's FAFSA application isn't appearing on her account Why?
2025-08-07 12:07:58,470 - INFO - Assistant response: To resolve this issue, ask the student if they have recently made any changes to their FAFSA online (e.g., school code). If so, they would need to get a confirmation that their change was processed. Once they confirm this, the ISIR SLA kicks in. Check CaneLink to ensure the student has an SSN on file and that there are no duplicate PowerFAIDS accounts due to SSN errors. Ask for a screenshot that the student successfully completed the FAFSA for the appropriate academic year. If you confirm that the student submitted correctly, ask the student which school code they put on their FAFSA. If the school code is correct and the SLA has passed from the date the FAFSA was submitted/school code corrected (whichever was last), escalate to Financial Aid for review.
