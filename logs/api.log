2025-08-05 09:47:33,523 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-08-05 09:47:33,524 - INFO - Answer generated: When there is an unsuccessful monthly payment plan (MPP) installment payment, the student will receive an email notice. If the balance remains at $0 or yields a refund after the unsuccessful payment, no billing notice will be sent. However, any missed payments beyond the first one will result in cancellation of the MPP. If a student has a Past Due Balance due to an unsuccessful installment, they may need to pay at the Cashier's Office for the payment to be made and the financial hold to be lifted, even though the balance on Flywire shows as $0.

The funds received by CIBC are delivered to UM within 2-3 business days after completion. However, if more than a week has passed and the funds have not been posted, it's recommended to contact the CC team for further assistance.

2025-08-07 12:07:58,458 - INFO - Answer generated: To resolve this issue, ask the student if they have recently made any changes to their FAFSA online (e.g., school code). If so, they would need to get a confirmation that their change was processed. Once they confirm this, the ISIR SLA kicks in. Check CaneLink to ensure the student has an SSN on file and that there are no duplicate PowerFAIDS accounts due to SSN errors. Ask for a screenshot that the student successfully completed the FAFSA for the appropriate academic year. If you confirm that the student submitted correctly, ask the student which school code they put on their FAFSA. If the school code is correct and the SLA has passed from the date the FAFSA was submitted/school code corrected (whichever was last), escalate to Financial Aid for review.
